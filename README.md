# flask-wrkshp-start

Join Terrapin Hackers for our first workshop of the semester!

This will be an introduction to Flask, a web application framework in python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to more complex applications. 

This workshop is great if you want to develop personal projects or kickstart that hackathon idea.

This repo will contain starter files for workshop.
 

Before coming:

* Clone the starter github repository you see here!

While working on this project, don't forget to activate the python virtual environment!
* `. venv/bin/activate` for linux
* `venv\Scripts\activate` for windows
